      <esp:h>About</esp:h>

      <p style="color: #ffbf00;">NOTE: This font is ready for use but is
      still being reviewed and corrected so it should be used
      critically.</p>
      
      <p>Oracc LAK is a fontification of A. Deimel, Liste der
      archaischen Keilschriftzeichen (WVDOG 40; Berlin 1922).</p>

      <p>There is an <esp:link url="/listfontdata/lak">Oracc List-Font
      Data page</esp:link> which provides alignnment information
      relating LAK to OSL and Unicode.</p>
      
      <esp:h>Original Font</esp:h>

      <p>PNG files of individual LAK signs were excerpted from a
      scanned copy by Steve Tinney.  They were turned into SVG files
      by Vijay Kethana and are available at <esp:link
      url="https://github.com/vkethana/cuneiform_convert">https://github.com/vkethana/cuneiform_convert</esp:link>.</p>

      <p>Steve Tinney aligned the SVG filenames with Unicode and
      created an initial TrueType font from the SVG files.  This font
      is still under development: it has been roughly resized and
      recentered but requires further tuning.  Some glyphs from the
      secondary boxes have been added to the font as salt variants and
      more will be added in the near future.</p>

      <esp:h>OpenType Features</esp:h>

      <p>Oracc-LAK makes use of <code>salt</code> to differentiate
      glyph variants of the same sign.  It also uses several
      Stylistic Sets (sset) as follows:</p>

      <dl>
	<dt>ss01</dt>
	<dd>Sign-forms from ED IIIa Fara texts. LAK sometimes uses
	earlier forms or forms from stone objects (especially the Blau
	monuments) as the reference glyph.  Selecting
	<code>ss01</code> ensures that ED IIIa forms from tablets are
	used.</dd>

	<dt>ss02</dt>
	<dd>This set selects forms from the Blau monuments--not all of
	these have been included in the font as yet.</dd>

	<dt>ss03</dt>
	<dd>A few Abu-Salabikh forms from Krebernik's OBO 160/1</dd>

	<dt>ss04</dt>
	<dd>A few Ebla forms from Krebernik's OBO 160/1</dd>
      </dl>
      
      <esp:h>CSS</esp:h>

      <p>In Oracc projects the font is selected with the CSS class <code>ofs-lak</code>.</p>
